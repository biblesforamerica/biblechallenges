When we introduced [BibleChallenges][biblechallenges] at the [National College Training][nct], we were hoping that a few hundred would sign up and begin to play with the site, and give us some feedback. As of today, there are 705 users, over 100 challenges, and nearly 2000 chapters logged. 

We installed [Intercom][intercom] to make it easier to hear from you, and we have heard, and are still hearing, loud and clear, your suggestions.

Here are some improvements that are a result of your feedback:

* Vanity URLs for challenges (instead of something like http://biblechallenges/challenges/233, you now see http://www.biblechallenges.com/challenges/entire-new-testament-in-august
* The "Add friends" option on a challenge page.  If you are logged in, you can enter someone's email address to add them to a challenge.  Use judiciously and do not spam people please.
* You can finally upload your avatar image successfully
* Ability to change the name of a challenge after it is created.
* Show your challenges first on the front page if you are logged in.  And hide challenges that are over.
* Showing the text of a chapter on the challenge page.  Now if you are logged in you should be able to find the chapters you are reading on the challenge page and click on them to see the text.
* This is probably the most asked for feature, and it took the most work:  **Being able to set end dates on a challenge.**  Now challenge creators can set the last day of the challenge and the scheduler will automatically schedule multiple chapters per day, as evenly as possible.  So you could read the whole New Testament in two months, for example.

And here are some things we are working on this week:

* Better login with facebook (and soon, google)
* Better challenge admin tools.  It seems that challenge creators would like better visibility into who signed up for a challenge, and be able to blast out a challenge-wide email now and then.

We would really like more feedback on usability.  What is frustrating you?

Here are some points for thought and if you have any feedback, put it in the comments below:

* The front page is mainly a list of challenges.  What information would be helpful to a first time visitor?  Should we show more info about each challenge on the front page?  Should we show a scrolling list of recent reading logs (like [Let The Word][ltw])?
* When a challenge ends, should an email go out to all participants that shows their statistics and ranks the groups according to various criteria?  What else could that email contain?
* Right now only groups have a comment wall for themselves.  Should we make a comment wall for every chapter that is read, so that the challenge participants can all discuss the reading for that day?
* Is there value in creating "private" or "hidden" challenges that can only be joined via invitation?  
* Is there value in creating "private" groups that can only be joined with a group key, ala [Let The Word][ltw])?
