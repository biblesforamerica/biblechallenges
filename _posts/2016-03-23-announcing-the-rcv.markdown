As many of you have already found out (as of just over one month ago), we have added the Recovery Version of the Bible to the BibleChallenges web app.

From the day that we introduced the site at the National College Training, many biblechallenges.com users have asked about including additional versions of the Bible for our daily reading.  That has been our goal from day one, (and we are still looking to add more).

Far and away, the most requested version has been the Recovery Version \[RcV\], and we’re pleased to let you know that you can change your Profile preferences to begin receiving emailed chapters and viewing challenge readings with the RcV translation.

The Verses are accessed from the Holy Bible Recovery Version (text-only) edition © 2012, via the Application Programming Interface at Living Stream Ministry [www.lsm.org](http://lsm.org "lsm.org").

I'll take this opportunity, too, to mention that we will be tweaking some features on the app during the next (few?) weeks.  We have collected a number of suggestions from your in-site feedback, and we hope to incorporate several of the suggestions, fix a few of the problems, and hopefully make the site more interesting/useful as a tool for our daily reading of God's Word!

But, again, we're happy to announce that we have initially addressed the #1 feature requested by biblechallenges.com users -- the Recovery Version!
