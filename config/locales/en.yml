      text1: "A Bible Challenge is a daily Bible reading schedule that allows you to read chapters in the Bible with others.  Each day a chapter of the Bible is sent to your email address.  After reading the chapter you can click a link to confirm that you have read the chapter and optionally participate in a discussion with others in your group."
      heading2: "Can I leave a Bible Challenge if I don't like it?"

      heading3: "How do I change my Bible version preference?"

      heading4: "I missed today's reading email.  How can I catch up?"
      text4: "The challenge page for your specific Bible reading challenge lists all of the Bible chapters in your challenge.  Simply click on the box next to any bible Chapter to indicate that you have finished reading that chapter.  If you get behind, you can read several chapters in a day and then check off all of these chapters at one time."
