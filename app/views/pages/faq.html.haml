    %h4.list-group-item-heading What is a Bible Challenge?
    %p.list-group-item-text
      A Bible Challenge is daily Bible reading schedule that allows you to read
      chapters in the Bible with others. Each day a chapter of the Bible is
      sent to your email address.  After reading the chapter you can click
      a link to confirm that you have read the chapter. You may choose to create/join
      a 'Group' within a Challenge and optionally participate in discussions with
      others in the Group.

      emails that you received from biblechallenges.com.  Clicking
      the unsubscribe link will remove you from the Bible Challenge and

    different one in my chapter reading(s).

      The BibleChallenges.com app accesses versions of the Bible that are:
      1) available online for use in the 'public domain', or,
      2) quoted, exercised within 'fair use' principles according to publisher
      requirements.  The Old Testament Bible versions that we currently
      access are limited to: the American Standard (ASV)-, the King James
      (KJV)-, and the Recovery (RCV)- versions of the Bible. If your current
      challenge reading is in the Old Testament, you will receive readings/view
      chapters in our 'default version', which we have set up as the RCV.
      If you wish to read a different version in the Old Testament (ASV, KJV),
      please update your preferences. (Our goal is to add more Bible versions
      in the future).
